# SurfPro Haus - CodiJr Challenge

This project is a landing page created for the selection process of Container Digital Jr, the junior company in the Systems and Digital Media course at the Federal University of Cear√°.

The landing page was created for SurfPro Haus, a fictional company I imagined that provides services to surfers through the production of content and the structuring of a club of advantages in purchases.

The central idea was the use of a web page formed by: navigation menu, illustrative carousel, company description, description of services, registration form, contacts and location. The company's voice seeks to be in accordance with the communicative reality of its target audience, seeking the natural informality of this reality.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used with the support of Bootstrap. Finally, images and icons from Unplash and Font Awesome were used respectively.
